# Frontend Engineer Quest

ðŸ™ŒÂ  Thank you for participating in this quest! Are you ready for an adventure? Let's get started!

_Why do we have quests?_ We use them to:

1. To understand your skill level and how you approach tasks. We want to make sure that you have the core skills to set you up for success as a future uizard ðŸ§™, while still giving you plenty of room to take on challenges.

2. For you to decide if itâ€™s the right role for you. Itâ€™s important to us that youâ€™ll love what youâ€™ll do and be able to explore new ideas and opportunities.

## âœ…Â **Instructions for Your Quest:**

- Complete the quest and submit your solution. Youâ€™re welcome to submit it as soon as you are done, we evaluate submissions continuously.
- Email us the solution by sending a single zip-file with the source code (without `node_modules` folder). If you have issues sending it as an attachment, please use a service like [wetransfer](http://wetransfer.com) to upload the zip and send the download link.

- After you hand in the challenge, we will review your submission and get back to you with next steps by email.

## â›°Â The **Quest: Build a Basic Editor**

For the quest, you will build a _very basic_ design editor using React. Users must be able to add, drag, and remove elements in the editor.

There are many different ways to scope and implement a solution. We recommend keeping it simple.

- Use React to render the elements in the DOM (do not use canvas).

- The editor should not persist state (no API, no local storage).

- Performance is not important â€“ the editor only needs to be capable of handling a handful of elements.

If youâ€™re comfortable with TypeScript, we encourage you to use it, but it is not a requirement.

### Requirements

- You must use the `create-react-app` utility to set up the project.

- You must build the drag-functionality yourself. Do not use libraries such as `react-draggable`.

### Reference Solution

As inspiration, we have attached a short video of a reference solution.

# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
